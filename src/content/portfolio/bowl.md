I began with the external design of, essentially, a cup. Cups are easy to hold in one hand, which is one of the major goals of the project. Thus, determining what materials to use is the key thing. To reiterate, the constraints for materials are:

 - Recyclable and compostable
 - Microwavable
 - Retains heat
 - Food-safe

I went through several iterations of materials for the bowl in order to determine what would be best.
Initially, I considered aluminum on the inside and paper on the outside. The aluminum would be food-safe, retain heat, and contain possible liquids. The paper on the outside would be used for texture, strength, and branding. The primary limitation of this combination of materials is that the aluminum - ordinarily a recyclable material - would potentially be covered in food. That means it could not be recycled nor composted, potentially creating more waste. Additionally, the paper is not necessarily strong enough to create a strong bowl on its own.
Then, I considered parchment on the inside, cardboard in the middle, and paper on the outside. The parchment would be compostable and food-safe. Because the parchment is the only material which touches the food, it could be composted separately from the cardboard and paper on the outside layers, which would be recycled.
For the final design, I ended up using just parchment and cardboard; the paper was unnecessary and just meant extra processing during recycling.

For construction, I used a box cutter to slice cardboard into small sections which could be wrapped up like a cup would. The diameter of the cup and the cap were chosen so that they would fit well into each other.

##Lessons Learned

 - **Plan construction**: Two problems came up during construction. First, the parchment couldn't be glued to the cardboard because it was non-stick! I had done prototypes using other materials and while glue worked there, I hadn't tested with parchment before. I got around it using duct tape. Secondly, I needed to join the parts of the cup, specifically the bottom to the sides. I used duct tape for these prototypes, but I would need to determine a better method to move this to full production.
 - **Prototyping works**: With this project, I created a few prototype models before creating a "final" prototype. It was very effective in determining the final dimensions of the cup, because it is difficult to judge until it is in your hand.
 - **Consider all stakeholders**: With this project, I had a particular focus on customers. However, there is an issue with these bowls for restaurant use as they do not stack particularly well. This should be considered as part of next steps.
