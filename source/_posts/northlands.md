This game is based on [Arctic Choices](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/arctic/what_we_do/arctic_choices.cfm), a board game created by the [Natural Capital project](http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org) to help teams of participants (business leaders, government officials, etc.) to understand the benefits and consequences of business development in highly climate-sensitive environments like the Arctic Circle.

I worked with UW EarthGames and Nature Capital to create the first demo version of an iPad educational board game using Unity. Collaborating with a small team, I planned and implemented the gameâ€™s data structure and essential game mechanics.
