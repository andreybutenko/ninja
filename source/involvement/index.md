<h2 style="margin-top: 8px;">Organizations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Design Manager</b> - Washington State Youth Summit for Equality
    <p>Responsible for various elements of design and content for WYSEQ. Specifically, I maintained the website and developed the conference's first-ever attendee packet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Co-President</b> - IHS Programming Club
    <p>Managed a small team to promote a newly-established club and organize programming-related events. Events include an Hour of Code and a hackathon.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>1st Place - Mobile App Development</b>
    <i>FBLA State, April 2017</i>
    <p>I created School Market, an app for FBLA chapters to help fundraise for FBLA Nationals. This app allows users to create and view listings for items to sell with multiple photos, suggested price, condition, and description. The listings also include deep links to contact the seller via SMS, Facebook Messenger, and Whatsapp. Comments with questions may also be added.</p>
    <p>The app is developed using Java with Android Studio as an IDE, and uses SugarORM as a database solution.</p>
    <p>Compared to traditional fundraising methods, this app has the potential to include a much more diverse selection of products, include the entire community, and create opportunities for mentorship by local business leaders.</p>
  </li>

    <b>1st Place - Mobile App Development</b>
    <i>FBLA State, April 2016</i>
    <p>I created Formal Wear, an Android app which helps students in FBLA, DECA, MUN, and other student organizations get feedback competition attire. Through this process, I developed both the front-end and back-end of the app, created documentation and a presentation for judges at FBLA, and came 1st place overall in FBLA State competition.</p>
    <p>This really gave me experience carrying a project out from start to finish. I had to plan the app, develop both the front-end and back-end of it, then publish it on Google Play. This is not something I had previously done, and it was a very valuable experience for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>1st Place - Business Service Operations Research</b>
    <i>DECA State, March 2016</i>
    <p>I worked with the HR Directory at the City of Bothell to create a comprehensive employee engagement strategy. The plan involved researching indicators of employee engagement, the best methods to improve engagement, and what the current state of engagement was at Bothell City Hall. Then, I worked with my partner to create the plan, document it, and present it to judges at DECA. We came 1st place overall in DECA State competition.</p>
    <p>Through this, I learned about employee engagement, how to work with real business people, and writing professional documents.</p>
