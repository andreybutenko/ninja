  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I am a student and software developer living in the Seattle area.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the last year, I have been focusing on mobile app development, but I am excited by any coding challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe inter-discipline knowledge is important in working on any project. Although my specialty is software development, I am eager to apply my familiarity with design and user experience principles to work towards a better product.
