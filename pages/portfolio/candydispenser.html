        <p>The goal of this project was to create a holiday toy that would be memorable for children by incorporating elements which stimulate different senses. It would have a nutcracker-like toy which is brightly colored and can, of course, be played with. The toy would sit on a stand with a clock built in, which would release candy along with a song each day.</p>
        <p>Although not the entire toy was constructed, much of it was. A prototype nutcracker, a colorful stand of the right proportions, and a candy dispenser - functioning with Little Bits - were constructed.</p>
