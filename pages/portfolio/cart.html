        <h1>Design Opportunity</h1>
        <p>
            In order to give students access to computers, many schools use laptop carts affectionately called COWs (computers on wheels).
            The benefit of these carts are that they're portable. The school doesn't need to buy one computer for each student; it's easy to share!
            However, in my own experiences, I've seen that these carts have fundamental issues which are only apparent in using them.
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, long lines form.
            The width of the cart is such that only one person can comfortably access it at a time.
            This is a problem when an entire classroom of students tries to get to the carts all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, cable management is an issue.
            It's not always clear what cable corresponds to what laptop, and thus students use the wrong cord.
            This deprives another student of their cable, who in turn uses someone else's cable.
            This is unsustainable.
            The entire cart ends up disorganized, and some students just don't plug their laptops in at all, leaving the next student with a discharged computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving the cart is an issue in itself.
            This is unfortunate, because portability is a huge part of the cart.
            On uneven paths, carts are difficult to control, especially considering how heavy they are.

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>
            In research, I went to a few sources.
            I interviewed students and teachers, and then went to see what existing products are available in the market.
            Additionally, I looked up best practices for ergonomics in heavy, industrial carts.
            I've summarized this information here.
        </p>
        <b>Key findings from student interviews:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>In accessing carts, students described needing to wait in line to access laptops. This likely stems from laptops only being accessible from one side of the cart, so only one or two people can access it at a time.</li>
            <li>Students described some laptops not being plugged in, leaving them discharged. This could mean one of a few things: it’s too difficult, it’s non-obvious, it’s too time-consuming, or students just do not care.</li>
            <li>In putting back laptops, students described some being plugged into the wrong charger, meaning other laptops have their chargers being occupied. This means it is not clear which plug corresponds to which slot.</li>
            <li>In moving carts, one student said that they are difficult to steer because of their weight. This may stem from all four wheels being able to rotate, giving less control over direction.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Key findings from teacher interviews:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>All teachers interviewed described cable management as being an issue, specifically needing to organize messy cables and plugging in laptops. This corresponds to the issues students described, meaning students either find it too difficult, too unclear, or generally too unimportant to deal with. This further indicates that this is a general problem that impacts not just students who use the carts, but teachers who must manage the carts.</li>
            <li>A teacher described difficulties moving the carts, specifically being too slow-moving when loaded, and too fast-moving when light. In either case, the laptop is difficult to control, which is consistent with what students reported.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Key findings from market research:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Majority of carts do not appear to have accessible handles, meaning this is a persistent issue.</li>
            <li>One cart addresses laptop access with shelves which can be pulled out. Although this makes it easier to get laptops out, it probably takes more time to replace laptops with this method.</li>
            <li>Another cart address laptop access with top-down accessibility. This likely is very effective, as it means users do not need to bend down to get laptops, and can access from many angles.</li>
            <li>There are a variety of exterior designs. One laptop has a very elegant exterior design of wood and metal, another is almost-solid dark metal, and another has lightly contrasting colors. This shows that there are a lot of options appropriate for school environment.</li>
            <li>It appears that that for most of the laptop carts researched, most wheels swivel. This gives more freedom of movement, but from student interviews, I found that carts are difficult to control.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Key findings from ergonomics research:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Casters should be made of hard plastic or inflatable tires and be 4 inches in diameter or larger.</li>
            <li>The height of handles should be between elbow and hip height. Ideally, these handles are adjustable so those pushing could be most comfortable. This adjustability should range between 29 and 47 inches. However, if an adjustable height system is not viable, continuous vertical handles suffice. In any case, the handle should be between 1.5 inches and 2.0 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Handles should be designed for pushing - rather than pulling - heavy carts. Additionally, these handles should not be wider than the cart itself.</li>
            <li>The contents of the cart should be stable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Design Brief and Marketing Specifications</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Problem Statement:</b> Students have difficulties using and transporting existing carts.
        </p>
        <span><b>Goal:</b> In order to address this problem, the goal is to create a laptop cart which addresses three recurring issues which came up in my user and market research:</span>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Accessing laptops.</b> Students have to bend down and take out laptops. This process may be fast for one student, but the typical design of a laptop cart only accommodates one user accessing it at a time, which results in line formation.</li>
            <li><b>Managing cables.</b> It is frequently unclear which cable goes to which laptops, resulting in students either plugging laptops in using the wrong cord or not plugging them in at all.</li>
            <li><b>Transporting carts.</b> Laptop carts are mobile by their very nature – they’re not just shared by a classroom, but by many classrooms. They need to be frequently transported, and are difficult to move and control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>IMG_20160324_114323.jpg
            <b>Target Market:</b> School districts which already use laptop carts to provide computer access to their students.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Features:</b> Although schools certainly have some interest in the accessibility and ease-of-transport for laptop carts, the bottom line for them is that carts must fulfill their needs. For this target market, carts must be able to hold enough laptops that a classroom is able to share.. Market research has shown this number to be between 30 and 36.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Constraints:</b> With this target market, the primary constraint will be price. School districts often have limited budgets, and the technology budget especially tends to be reduced. Market analysis indicates that cart prices begin at $1,676, so that price should be the target for the final design in order to be competitive in the market.

        <h1>Conceptual Design</h1>
        <p>
            First, I looked at various charging mechanisms to solve the core issue of line formation.
            I thought that some form of docking mechanism would work well: students would not need to directly interact with cords, so the line will progress faster and the cords will be neater.
            However, I wanted a universal solution.
            Creating a dock would mean every model of laptop needs its own dock designed and built to accomodate its size and height of plug.
            Schools should not be restricted by their cart when choosing what laptops to buy.
            The cart should be compatible with as many laptops as possible such that it can last through many generations of laptops as the needs of the school change.
            But there is something valuable in this design in that it can slot into existing carts rather than requiring a whole new cart.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then looked at wireless charging; it could be easily installed onto any laptop and slotted into existing carts.
            However, there is the issue of power adaption for different models of laptop, as well as the issue of price.
        </p>
        <p>
            I returned to the docking idea again.
            The fundamental issue with the first iteration of the dock idea was that it contained the carts, making it restrictive.
            If we remove the borders and make height of the outlet adjustable, we'll have a slot which is compatible with any laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what I settled on is the simplest solution.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            The problem, as shown on the left, is that cords come out in between carts. This is ambiguous,
            and the most effective and straightforward solution is to just make it more clear. So cords will
            come out directly from the side of the laptop such that it will be clear what corresponds to what.
        </p>
    </div>

    </div>

        <p>
            Given this, I looked at several methods to attempt to reduce lines. An obvious solution is to just
            create more faces to access the laptops. For example, the laptops can be accessed from either side
            of the cart as opposed to just one. But this is clearly a "band-aid" rather than a real solution;
            lines will still form, even if they're distributed across two.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accessing laptops from the top appears to be the most effective solution. Instead of students
            needing to line up at all, they can just gather around. Many people can fit around a table, and
            that is the sort of dynamic this creates. However, unlike a table, people are not going to stand
            there for long. Students will just grab a laptop and leave. This means that there will never be a
            line formed!
        </p>
    </div>

            There is also the need to determine how to remain flexible for different laptop sizes.
            Different school districts have different needs, and these needs change over time.
            It would be expensive and wasteful to require school districts to purchase new sets of both laptops
            and carts every time they upgrade. Therefore, the solution I designed accomodates for any size of
            laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
            The edges of the cart itself has notches for long dividers, and these are adjusted based on the width
            of the laptops. These long dividers have more notches smaller dividers, which are adjusted based on
            the thickness of the laptops.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a very flexible system, and means that the laptop cart is compatible with the unique needs of many
            districts and schools
        </p>
        <div class="gallery gallery-single">
            <div class="image" style="background-image: url('/assets/img/portfolio/cart/SCN_0017.jpg')"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
            There are also a few details which need to be decided. In terms of wheels, there is a need to both
            provide the flexibility for students to navigate carts around the narrow corners of schools while
            at the same time keeping the cart straight on uneven sidewalks. By installing four swivel wheels
            on the four corners of the cart and one rigid wheel in the very center (a "fifth wheel"), I accomplish
            a compromise between these needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, handles must be considered. Existing handles are inflexible, and don't accomodate the
            needs of students. Students are of all different heights, and what works for one person may not work for
            another. A possibility is to install a custom handle which is either rotatable or with notches such that
            students can adjust them. This meets this need, but means they must be reconfigured each time and are at
            risk to break. I read guidelines for designing handles for heavy, industrial carts, and based on this knowledge
            I decided to use continuous vertical handles. They meet the needs of different people while not needing configuration.

        <p>
            I put my prototype cart into a real history classroom, filled it with laptops, and let students use it.
            What I found was that my solution for reducing lines was very effective; there was never any backup, and
            the process generally went much more smoothly. I did determine through this that the smaller dividers
            between laptops are able to be rotated slightly in such a way that a laptop can take up two slots if a student
            is not careful. This can be fixed in future models through more tight-fitting notches.

            I largely met my design specifications in usability and transportation, aesthetics and materials, sustainability,
            and target market. The main targets I didn't meet was the automatic energy usage reducing system (3.1) and
            security features (4.6). Given more time, I'd be able to meet all of these specs.
