        <p>This desk organizer was designed to accommodate the unique needs of the Design Technology classroom. Especially in the middle of projects, there is no space on the desk for any type of organizer. By considering the type of tables in use, I worked in a team to create an organizer which has dedicated space for pencils, a scissor mount, a place for sticky notes, and another for the miscellaneous small items which youâ€™d have out during a project.</p>
