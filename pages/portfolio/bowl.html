        <p>To-Go boxes are inconvenient. They are not designed to be hand-held: they’re often large, with nothing you can really grip onto with one hand, which means that you cannot eat from them comfortably. They’re not microwavable: if someone is staying in a hotel without dishes, they’ll be unable to heat food later. They’re bad for the environment: styrofoam is not recyclable or compostable. These are problems I wanted to address in the development of my To-Go Bowl.</p>

        <h1>Case Studies</h1>
        <p>First, I looked at a typical styrofoam To-Go box. Although they have the unique and useful property of having compartments for separating food, they are difficult to eat out of while moving, they cannot be microwaved, they are bad for the environment, and they are not always closed well.</p>
        <p>The design of McDonalds’ french fry box is actually very unique. It is compact, visually friendly, keeps food accessible, is one-handed, and is made out of paper. Unfortunately, they cannot hold larger foods and do not stand on their own.</p>
        <p>Food thermoses are good in that they retain heat and are easy to transport, but they do have some downsides. They are hard to wash, not microwavable, and keep food deep so that it’s sometimes difficult to access. Additionally, they are pretty expensive, which means that they are not suitable for restaurants to give out with food to-go.</p>
        <p>Thus, it’s clear that none of the options available to restaurants are ideal for portable use, take-home use, and sustainable disposability.</p>

        <h1>Possibilities: Systems-Level or Product-Level?</h1>
        <p>After exploring a few design options, creating a better thermos seemed to be a possible option. However, this would mean not just mean creating a product which is used for to-go foods, but also working with restaurants to use them. For example, customers could bring their own to-go thermoses with them to restaurants. The issue in this is that customers without thermoses will still need to use inconvenient, wasteful to-go boxes.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, this could be a community project, where thermoses could be collected in bins alongside trash and recycling. There are unique issues with this which do cause additional waste, specifically washing, transportation, and theft. However, it is interesting conceptually.</p>
        <p>Despite these interesting solutions which could be implemented at a systems-level, that direction not only has unique challenges with no guarantee of success, but also would be mostly repurposing existing thermoses and not designing an original product which is really my goal with this project. With that in mind, I began to design the To-Go Bowl</p>

        <h1>To-Go Bowl Design and Construction</h1>
        <p>I began with the external design of, essentially, a cup. Cups are easy to hold in one hand, which is one of the major goals of the project. Thus, determining what materials to use is the key thing. To reiterate, the constraints for materials are:</p>
        <ul class="no-top-margin">
            <li>Recyclable and compostable</li>
            <li>Microwavable</li>
            <li>Retains heat</li>
            <li>Food-safe</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I went through several iterations of materials for the bowl in order to determine what would be best.</p>
        <p>Initially, I considered aluminum on the inside and paper on the outside. The aluminum would be food-safe, retain heat, and contain possible liquids. The paper on the outside would be used for texture, strength, and branding. The primary limitation of this combination of materials is that the aluminum - ordinarily a recyclable material - would potentially be covered in food. That means it could not be recycled nor composted, potentially creating more waste. Additionally, the paper is not necessarily b enough to create a b bowl on its own.</p>
        <p>Then, I considered parchment on the inside, cardboard in the middle, and paper on the outside. The parchment would be compostable and food-safe. Because the parchment is the only material which touches the food, it could be composted separately from the cardboard and paper on the outside layers, which would be recycled.</p>
        <p>For the final design, I ended up using just parchment and cardboard; the paper was unnecessary and just meant extra processing during recycling.</p>
        <p>For construction, I used a box cutter to slice cardboard into small sections which could be wrapped up like a cup would. The diameter of the cup and the cap were chosen so that they would fit well into each other.</p>

        <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Plan construction</b>: Two problems came up during construction. First, the parchment couldn’t be glued to the cardboard because it was non-stick! I had done prototypes using other materials and while glue worked there, I hadn’t tested with parchment before. I got around it using duct tape. Secondly, I needed to join the parts of the cup, specifically the bottom to the sides. I used duct tape for these prototypes, but I would need to determine a better method to move this to full production.</li>
            <li><b>Prototyping works</b>: With this project, I created a few prototype models before creating a “final” prototype. It was very effective in determining the final dimensions of the cup, because it is difficult to judge until it is in your hand.</li>
            <li><b>Consider all stakeholders</b>: With this project, I had a particular focus on customers. However, there is an issue with these bowls for restaurant use as they do not stack particularly well. This should be considered as part of next steps.</li>
